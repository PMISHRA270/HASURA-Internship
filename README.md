# MusiConekt
This is a webapp which i built during the course of my internship at Hasura.
The idea behind MusiConekt is to allow various musicians to find and connect with a musician as per their requirement.
You can access the webapp at http://musiconekt.herokuapp.com/
Please note:The app is served with the help of ngrok tunneling,i.e.,the server to the webapp is my laptop itself.So,if you find that the app is offline you can contact me so that i can make the app go live again.
